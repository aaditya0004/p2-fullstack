## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project was created for a hackathon to build a professional SaaS billing system from the ground up. The platform handles multiple security modules, simulates payment processing, manages user subscriptions, generates invoices, and gracefully handles payment edge cases. Our coaching-driven, step-by-step approach ensured a robust and feature-complete application, built one testable piece at a time.

## üß† Our Thought Process & Development Journey

We adopted a "Crawl, Walk, Run" methodology to tackle this complex project, ensuring a solid foundation before moving on to advanced features.

### üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step-by-Step Build Log:

1.  **Blueprint & Design (Crawl):** We started by creating a detailed **Design Document**, outlining our database schemas (Users, Plans, Subscriptions, Invoices) and the required API endpoints. This planning phase was crucial to ensure a clear path forward.

2.  **Backend Foundation (Crawl):** We set up a basic **Node.js/Express.js server** and connected it to a free-tier **MongoDB Atlas** cloud database. This established the core communication layer of our application.

3.  **Secure User Authentication (Walk):** We built a complete, secure authentication system.
    * `POST /api/users/register`: For new user sign-ups with password hashing (`bcryptjs`).
    * `POST /api/users/login`: For user login, which generates a secure **JSON Web Token (JWT)** for session management.

4.  **Subscription Plans (Walk):** We created the backend infrastructure to manage the product catalog, allowing an admin to create and list various subscription plans.

5.  **Payment Gateway Simulation (Walk):** To avoid KYC blockers during the hackathon, we smartly pivoted from a live payment gateway to a **simulated payment system**. This allowed us to build and test the entire subscription creation flow without any external dependencies.

6.  **Full-Stack Integration (Run):** We built the **Next.js frontend** and connected it to our backend, tackling CORS issues and fetching real-time data from our API to display on the UI.

7.  **Dynamic Frontend (Run):** We implemented a robust frontend authentication flow using **React Context API**, allowing for a dynamic UI that changes based on the user's login status.

8.  **Core Feature Implementation (Run):** We then rapidly built out the key features:
    * **User Dashboard:** A page for users to view and manage their active subscriptions.
    * **Billing & Invoice History:** A professional table view of all user invoices.
    * **Profile Management:** A secure page for users to view and update their company details.
    * **Subscription Cancellation:** Allowing users to cancel their active plans.
    * **PDF Invoice Generation:** Added a "Download PDF" feature using `jspdf` for a professional touch.

9.  **Edge Case Handling (Polish):** We simulated a complete payment failure and recovery workflow, demonstrating a deep understanding of real-world billing challenges.
    * A "Fail" button changes a subscription to `past_due`.
    * This generates an `unpaid` invoice.
    * A "Pay Now" button resolves the invoice and sets the subscription back to `active`.
